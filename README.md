# Autocompiler for c++
this is just a simple script i wrote for myself, because i was tired of compiling c++ code again and again. this script watches your file and look for changes as soon as there is a change (its only when you save the file) it compiles the file.

## Quick start
1. first clone the script
	`git clone https://github.com/atharvParlikar/autocompile-cpp.git`
2. then just edit the filepath and command
3. and just run the script and youre good to go üëç
